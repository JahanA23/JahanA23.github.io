Working for an organisation most likely has Domain controllers, group policies and identifiable computers in place. Therefore, I must introduce myself to the client and ask for more details, for example, the PC they are on.

Professionalism is essential. Being polite and assuring customers that they are in good hands is important. 

We have a rough idea of the issue but must always ask clients questions to get the probable cause.
